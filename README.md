## Goals
 - keep simple
 - develop a web application that interacts with geolocalized maps
 - find library for displaying geolocalized maps
 - focus on front-end app

## Task
Develop a web application that allows you to manage mappers and missions.
Missions belong to campaigns, the campaigns are composed of description and name
There is no need for a database, static data is enough.

Let's divide it into two sections:
 - Mapper section with the list and the missions they have done, including display on a geolocalized map
 - Campaign section with mission list and geolocalized map display

It is not necessary to do the CRUD for campaigns, missions and mappers. 
All you have to do is list view.

The presentation of the data is also evaluated as well as the technical solution.

## Solution

The solution uses Next.JS, you can run it by:

1. Install the dependencies by running the command `npm install`
2. Then, start the development server by running the command `npm run dev`
3. Finally, [open it in a browser](http://localhost:3000)

I've also deployed, so it can also be accessed at https://mind-earth.vercel.app/
